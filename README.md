# Chefin
This web application is created in order to people can find cooking recipes and share it with each other. 

# Instruction to run:
1) open any code editor and create a virtual environment. The code was written on Python. You could create an environment on Visual Studio Code, for example, and run this command: py -m venv env
2) create or download the chef.py file
3) create templates folder and put recipe.html and index.html files in it
4) generate new API on Spoonacular API and write it to API_KEY in chef.py file
5) run the code

I used the API from Spoonacular API, because it is easier to get and implement. Then created a folder named "templates", which was used to store html files and was responsible for design of the application. Then I created the "chef.py" file, main python file in which the main code was written. 
The specific information about the recipe was got from Spoonacular API, that is GET request was sent to get specicif information about the specific recipe.
